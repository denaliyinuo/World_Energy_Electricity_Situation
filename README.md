# World Energy and Electricity Situation and The Transition to a Zero Carbon Future

# Overview

It is readily apparent that the world needs to rapidly transition to a zero carbon future in the coming decades, as an increase in droughts and natural disasters has already lead to famines and will lead to ever increasing mass migrations due to regional conflicts over ever scarce food and water resources.  World leaders have been pushing for investments in renewable energy, energy storage, green building technologies, along with a host of other methods to reduce energy consumption. Below is a simplified version of the transition from the current state of the world's energy generation and consumption to a carbon neutral future.

# Global Energy and ELectricity Situation

In order to realize a carbon neutral future, all energy generation and consumption needs to be included in the grid.  This means that all energy production will need to remove fossil fuels, such as coal, gas, and oil, and replace them with renewable energy sources and nuclear power.  Energy consumption will also have to be 100% electrified.  This means that all combustion vehicles, including all cars, trucks, trains, etc., will need to consume electricity. All natural gas and coal furnaces for residential water heating will need to be replaced with electric boilers.  Another alternative to replacing the non-connected grid consumption devices will be to use hydrogen fuel cell technology, but it appears electricity and batteries will be leading the switch from fossil fuels to carbonless technologies.

The world's electricity situation, as shown in the upper right chart, shows no significant increase in energy consumption from renewable energy sources over the past 20-30 years.  Natural gas production has increased in the past 10 years, coninciding with a decrease in nuclear energy, notably in countries like Japan and Germany.  Renewable energy has offset the decreases in nuclear energy, and unsurprisingly in the past 10 years, appears to be setting a trend of slow but steady trend of an increase in renewable energy.  It is expected that in the next decade, a significant portion of electric vehicles will be electric, thus requiring a demand for more electricity production.  A combination of hydro, nuclear, as well as wind, solar, and energy storage to smooth out the variations in electricity supply will be needed.
